// capture.py

This appears to be a Python module for writing PCAP (packet capture) files. The PCAPFile class defined in the code provides a way to create a PCAP file and write packets to it. The __init__ method initializes a new PCAP file by writing a header to the file using the pack method from the struct module. The write method takes some data representing a packet and writes it to the file along with a timestamp. The close method simply closes the file.
