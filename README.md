# Python-For-Security

Python-for-security is a GitHub repository that contains a collection of Python scripts for security-related tasks. The repository contains the following folders:

1.) Banner reading from open ports: This folder contains scripts for reading banners from open ports on a network. This can be useful for gathering information about the services running on a particular host.

2.) Brute-forcing an ssh connection: This folder contains scripts for attempting to brute-force an ssh connection to a remote host. This can be used as a last resort when trying to gain access to a system that you don't have the login credentials for.

3.) Create socket connection: This folder contains scripts for creating socket connections in Python. This can be useful for establishing network connections between two hosts.

4.) Create a port scanner: This folder contains scripts for scanning a network for open ports. This can be useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities on a network.

5.) Ethernet frames from RAW packets: This folder contains scripts for creating Ethernet frames from RAW packets in Python. This can be useful for creating custom network packets for testing and analysis.

6.) Packet capture output: This folder contains scripts for capturing and outputting network packets in Python. This can be useful for monitoring network traffic and analyzing network activity.

7.) Packet sniffing with Python: This folder contains scripts for sniffing network packets in Python. This can be useful for capturing and analyzing network traffic in real-time.

8.) These scripts can be useful for security professionals and hobbyists alike. Please use them responsibly and only on systems that you have permission to access.
