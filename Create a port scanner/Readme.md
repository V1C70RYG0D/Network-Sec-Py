This script defines a Scanner class that can be used to scan a range of ports on a given IP address to determine which ports are open. The Scanner class is initialized with an IP address, and it has methods for scanning a range of ports, adding open ports to a list, and writing the list of open ports to a file. The main() function uses the Scanner class to scan the range of ports from 1 to 65,000 on the IP address '10.0.13.231', and writes the list of open ports to the file './open_ports'. The timefunc decorator is used to time the execution of the main() function.
