// grab.py
This script defines a Grabber class that creates a socket connection to a specified IP address and port. The read method of the Grabber class can be used to read data from the socket, and the close method can be used to close the socket connection. When the script is run, it creates an instance of the Grabber class and uses it to read data from a socket and then close the connection.
