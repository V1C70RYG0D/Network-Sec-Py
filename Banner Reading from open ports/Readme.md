// grab.py

This script defines a Grabber class that creates a socket connection to a specified IP address and port. The read method of the Grabber class can be used to read data from the socket, and the close method can be used to close the socket connection. When the script is run, it creates an instance of the Grabber class and uses it to read data from a socket and then close the connection.

// grab_and_scan.py

This script defines a Scanner class from the port_scanner module and a Grabber class from the grabber module. It also uses a timefunc decorator from the utils module to measure the execution time of the main function.

The main function creates an instance of the Scanner class and uses it to scan a range of ports on the specified IP address. It then iterates over the list of open ports and attempts to create a Grabber instance for each open port. If successful, the Grabber instance is used to read data from the socket and then close the connection. If an error occurs, it is caught and printed
